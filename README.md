# README

Storyline is a communal storytelling app. The idea is simple: anyone can start a story, and anyone can add the next sentence to someone else’s story. The only restriction is that users can’t post two times in a row to the same story. Users can upvote stories and sentences that they like, and stats pages keep track of how many upvotes a user has.

## Using Storyline locally

Clone the repository + run `bundle` + run `rails s` +  head over to localhost:3000 in a browser.

## Contributions

If you have any ideas or notice something that could be improved, bug reports and pull requests are always welcome.
